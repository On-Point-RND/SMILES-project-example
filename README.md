This is an example of the repository for SMILES-2025 students' project. This example includes **all the necessary components**:

| File name | Description | Should be modified | By whom |
|-----|-------------|-------------|------------|
| README | File with the general information regarding the project | ❌ NO | -- |
| README_curators | File with the project description for students | ✅ Yes | Curators |
| LICENSE | License required for the project | ✅ Yes | Curators |
| README_students | The template for students' report | ✅ Yes | Students |
| figures/ | The folder where all the figures for a report should be put | ✅ Yes | Students |

❗**NOTE:** the best students projects will be included into SMILES Proceedings -- the collection of students' reports. Some of the parts from `README_curators` will be **copied and pasted** into the final report (into `README_students` and then further into **LaTeX** for the best works).
